Hello! My name is Nicholas Flood, but I like to go by Chance. I am a passionate and hardworking student that is currently looking for ways to break into the field of technology, particularly in cloud, devops, security, and software engineering. I consider myself a continuous learner and I am willing to do anything that is within my power to improve as an individual on a professional and personal level. I enjoy teaching and mentoring other passionate students that have an interest in technology and I love to collaborate with others on projects. I am currently double majoring in Cybersecurity and Cybercrime at Old Dominion University, and I serve as the Community Manager for the Coastal Virginia Cybersecurity Student Association (CVCSA).
